# Demodia's Digital Assets

Welcome to the Demodia Assets repository! We're a modern B2B digital marketing agency, and this is our digital toolbox. It's packed with reusable components, utility scripts, styles, JSON data files, and image files. These are the ingredients we use to create stunning digital experiences for our clients.

## üèóÔ∏è Structure

Our repository is structured to ensure clarity and ease of use:

- `components/`: This is where our reusable components live. Each one has its own dedicated directory and a README file that serves as its user manual.
- `data/`: Our JSON data files are stored here, ready to provide the information you need.
- `utilities/`: This is the home of our utility scripts and styles. Each utility has its own directory and a README file, making it easy to understand what each tool does.
- `images/`: This is our gallery of image files, ready to add visual appeal to your projects.

## üåê Usage

We serve our files using JSDelivr, a free public CDN that's as reliable as a Swiss watch. To use a file in your project, link to it like this:

`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Demodia/assets/{{ folder/file.ext }}`

For example, to use the `docEventPromise.js` utility, you would link to it like this:

https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Demodia/assets/utilities/docEventPromise.js

And for minified files, just add `.min` before the file extension:

https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Demodia/assets/utilities/docEventPromise.min.js

## üìú License

We believe in the power of sharing, which is why this project is licensed under the MIT License. For the legalese, see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.

So, go ahead and explore our repository. We hope you find it as useful as we do. Remember, in the world of digital marketing, it's not just about the tools you have, but how you use them. Happy coding! üéâ

At Demodia, we're all about eliminating wasteful expenditure and maximising the effectiveness of customer acquisition and retention programmes. We hope this repository helps you do the same. Enjoy!
